The app takes the ```filename.txt``` file from ```in``` folder, reads it and ask user to tranlate words. Then automatically relplaces every further occurency of already translated word with thranslation in terminal. 

The app also creates the dictionary file ```dic_file-name.txt```, saves the progress in ```save_filename.txt``` and creates ```trans_filename.txt``` file with translated text in ```out``` directory.
